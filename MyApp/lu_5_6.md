Some of the things I did differently from my class lesson:
1. used mysql_python_connector instead of flask-mysqldb
2. didn't add my password into the connectors config. Instead i used getpass and input to prompt for password. personally i think this is a better practice.
3. didn't set to dictionary=True the equivalent of DictCursor. reckon that this a small table with 6 or less columns used for pratice, i prefer to use list index to get item.
4. used form.html for form handling of addUser.
5. used f string for sql commands instead of the c way of concatenating strings. personally i find f string a better way of working with strings. the pythonic way.
5. closed all connection cursors to ensure they have no connection to original connection object.
