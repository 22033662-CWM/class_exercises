instructions:
1. create templates directory in MyApp directory
2. the reason why templates contain css files is we are running the exercises' htmls as file in browser hence having the css files under static directory won't work.

file structure should look like this:

```
MyApp
|--__init__.py
|--routes.py
|--+static
|  |--exercise.css
|  |--mystyle.css
|--+images
|    |--all the jpg files
|--+templates
|     |--the rest of the exercises' html files
|     |--the rest of the exercises' css files
|
```
