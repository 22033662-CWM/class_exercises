`not a subject i enjoy very much` :confused: :cry: :tired_face:

### Instructions to run the test server and pages:

1. install the files in a directory named MyApp as the codes search for "MyApp". If another directory name is desired, remember to change **MyApp** in the codes to the desired directory name
2. go to command prompt (make sure to use the correct environment's command prompt, i.e. the env you installed flask :wink:)
3. for windows run: <span style="color:red">***set FLASK_APP=MyApp***</span>, for mac run: <span style="color:red">***export FLASK_APP=MyApp***</span>
4. change to the <span style="color:red">**parent directory**</span> of MyApp (or the <span style="color:red">**parent directory**</span> where the *__init.py__* and *routes.py* reside in) 
5. type ***flask run*** to start server
6. start a browser and try these which are found in routes.py:
    - *localhost:5000/index*
    - *localhost:5000/nice/your_name*
    - *localhost:5000/day*
    - *localhost:5000/today*
    - *localhost:5000/eat/durian*
    - *localhost:5000/consume/bread*
    - *localhost:5000/mypage*
7. solution to exercise on pg 58 in routes.py too:
    - *localhost:5000/viewproduct/Starry*
    - *localhost:5000/viewproduct/Aurora*
8. added another test - rendering page from another file
    - *localhost:5000/hello/your_name*
